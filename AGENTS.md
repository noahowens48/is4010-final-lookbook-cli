AI Tools Used

I used ChatGPT mainly for brainstorming and figuring out the structure of my project. It helped me outline what the CLI app should do, how to organize the files, and what features made sense for the final.
I used GitHub Copilot while writing the actual code. It helped fill in functions, suggest cleaner logic, and speed up writing repetitive parts.

How I Used AI

Planning & Brainstorming:
ChatGPT helped me narrow down my idea and shape it into an actual project. It gave me the first outline of the commands, the file structure, and what tests I needed.

Code Generation:
Copilot helped write small pieces of code faster (like helper functions, argparse setup, and test boilerplate). I still reviewed and edited everything myself.

Debugging:
When something broke, like imports or file path issues, I used ChatGPT to figure out the cause and understand the fix.

Learning New Concepts:
I used AI to better understand argparse, package structure, and how pytest works in a real project.

Example Prompts

Some prompts I used during the project:

“Help me outline a Python CLI app that stores clothing items and generates outfits.”

“Why am I getting ImportError: cannot import name load_items in my module?”

“Show me how to structure argparse with subcommands.”

“Write pytest tests for a filtering function.”

“How should a GitHub Actions workflow look for running pytest?”

Reflection

AI honestly made this project way smoother. It helped me understand stuff faster and saved time on boilerplate so I could focus on actual logic. It felt like having someone explain things step-by-step while I still wrote and controlled the final code.

Challenges

AI can sometimes overcomplicate things or give code that doesn’t fully match my file layout. I had to double-check suggestions, rewrite parts, and test everything myself. It’s helpful, but you can’t blindly trust what it gives you.
